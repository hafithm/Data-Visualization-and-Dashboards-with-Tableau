# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
- The primary objective of this project is to decode the intricacies of the New York City Airbnb market. The focus lies on understanding how rental prices, room types, and host activities influence guest reviews and accommodation popularity. This analysis is significant not only for Airbnb users but also for prospective hosts and policymakers. By scrutinizing various facets such as neighborhood trends, seasonal patterns, and pricing strategies, this project aims to unearth actionable insights that could enhance the Airbnb experience in NYC.

### 
- Step 1: Conducted an initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to comprehend the data structure and main variables.
- Step 2. Cleaned the data by filtering irrelevant columns and normalizing text fields for consistency. Ensured data integrity by handling missing values and outliers.
- Step 3. Created a series of visualizations in Tableau to represent different data dimensions, including geographical distribution, pricing, and host-related metrics.
- Step 4. Segmented the data by room type and neighborhood to identify patterns and trends affecting the Airbnb landscape.
- Step 5. Employed advanced Tableau features such as parameters and calculated fields to add interactivity and depth to the visualizations.
- Step 6. Synthesized the visual analytics into a cohesive narrative within a Tableau story, ensuring a logical flow that guides the audience through the findings.
