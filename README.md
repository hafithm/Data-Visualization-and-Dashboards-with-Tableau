# Tableau-Project

## Project/Goals
- The primary objective of this project is to decode the intricacies of the New York City Airbnb market. The focus lies on understanding how rental prices, room types, and host activities influence guest reviews and accommodation popularity. This analysis is significant not only for Airbnb users but also for prospective hosts. By looking over various topics such as neighborhood trends, seasonal patterns, and pricing strategies, this project aims to dig up actionable insights that could enhance the Airbnb experience in NYC.

### Process
- Step 1: Conducted an initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to comprehend the data structure and main variables.
- Step 2. Cleaned the data by filtering irrelevant columns and normalizing text fields for consistency. Ensured data integrity by handling missing values and outliers.
- Step 3. Created a series of visualizations in Tableau to represent different data dimensions, including geographical distribution, pricing, and host-related metrics.
- Step 4. Segmented the data by room type and neighborhood to identify patterns and trends affecting the Airbnb landscape.
- Step 5. Employed advanced Tableau features such as parameters and calculated fields to add interactivity and depth to the visualizations.
- Step 6. Synthesized the visual analytics into a cohesive narrative within a Tableau story, ensuring a logical flow that guides the audience through the findings.



## Results
The project's outcomes included a comprehensive suite of Tableau dashboards and stories, providing a multi-dimensional view of the NYC Airbnb market. Key visualizations included:
- Geospatial analysis highlighting hotspots for Airbnb listings and how they correlate with pricing.
- Comparative charts showcasing room type availability and their respective pricing across neighborhoods.
- Temporal trend graphs illustrating seasonal variations in pricing and review frequency.
- Analysis of host activity patterns, revealing insights on how the 'Host Since' date influences listing prices and guest reviews.

The findings underscore the variation in rental prices across neighborhoods, with Manhattan emerging as the most expensive, and the outer boroughs offering more affordable options. Room types showed a distinct preference, with entire homes/apartments being the most available yet private rooms having a higher relative availability.

## Challenges 
The project entailed navigating through a vast dataset with numerous variables. Isolating the most relevant factors for analysis required meticulous data exploration and feature selection. Crafting a compelling story from complex data presented a notable challenge, necessitating a balance between detail and digestibility. Another challenge I faced was when Tableau didn't know New York City's neighborhoods by name, which was key for my map. So, I used Python to match those neighborhoods with their zip codes. This let me map everything out clearly in Tableau.

## Future Goals
Looking ahead, the project could benefit from a impure analysis of sub-neighborhood trends and the impact of specific amenities on rental pricing and popularity. Incorporating external datasets, such as tourist footfall and event calendars, could further enrich the analysis. Additionally, predictive modeling to forecast market dynamics could provide a forward-looking angle to the study.
